# What is Trackers?

Trackers is (or will be) an Android App for athletes, coaches and teams looking for a way to keep track of their training sessions or their athlete's. 

For athletes, it's thought to help you focus on giving it all in your sessions without stressing about what you have to do or how hard you need to push it, Trackers will be your second brain for all that.

For coaches and teams its an easy way to assign daily, weekly or montly plans to their athletes. Just like an assignment, athletes will receive their training instructions and give feedback about it, giving you a deeper understanding about your athlete's strengths and improvement aspects. All that data will also be useful to follow the performance of every athlete throughout time.
